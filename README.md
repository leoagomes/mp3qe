This program was made so my brother could easily change all the names in his mp3 folder. Then I implemented another function that would change the MP3's name inside an ID3 tag.

I'm really sorry, but I suck at documenting. I'll try as hard as I can, though. Also, I don't change the names of the methods or the name of buttons...

I speak portugese as my mother toung, so some of the variables may be in language.

This program was made so you could easily change the name of the songs inside a folder.

There are two modes of operation:

1 - The first gets the MP3's name inside of the ID3 tag to the name of the file so if you have a file with name "Song" inside of the ID3 tag, but "blabla_[www.website.com]_sOnG.mp3" as the file name, the program changes the file name to "Song.mp3"

2 - This is the total opposite. It gets the file name of a song ("Song.mp3") and changes the ID3 tag name to "Song".

These are intended for use in an entire folder, so be sure about what you're doing so you don't end up messing up with all the songs.
