This program was made so my brother could easily change all the names in his mp3 folder. Then I implemented another function that would change the MP3's name inside an ID3 tag.

I'm really sorry, but I suck at documenting. I'll try as hard as I can, though. Also, I don't change the names of the methods or the name of buttons...

I speak portugese as my mother toung, so some of the variables may be in language.
